# panda3d-interrogator
ffi experiment with interrogate C bindings

first target :

    MicroPython  https://github.com/micropython/micropython



requires cpython 3.7+  ( 3.6 NOT TESTED )

requires Panda3D , not the "pip" version, as it won't work because you need C++ part of sdk
see https://www.panda3d.org/download/sdk-1-10-4-1/ [other downloads]
or better build from source and install to /usr/local <= match current test conditions

requires https://github.com/pmp-p/fstrings_helper


```
# run interrogate to get the lib/interrogate_wrapper.cpp from lib/lib.*
./test_i.sh

# link the c++ libupanda_cpp.so then build its C only interface libupanda_c.so
# there a test for both
./shared.sh


#test micropython build ( need uctypes and ffi modules enabled on unix port )
./test_upy.sh

# enjoy micropython bindings in tests/testpy.py
# and write your own game in place of the test
# ( kidding there is not whole Panda3D API in there ! -yet- )
```

Thanks thetestgame for teasing with C bindings.
Thanks rdb and Câ€‹FSworks for help on implementation.
Thanks to pfalcon for micropython-ffigen inspiration.
